## Purpose of this project

Contrary to what you might think, this is **not** a tutorial app. I wrote this from scratch when I was first learning React. The react code itself isn't very interesting. However, the most interesting stuff will be found under the [/src/lib](https://github.com/aarona/react-minesweeper/tree/master/src/lib) directory.

The main purpose of this application was to **test deploying production React builds to Heroku**. See below for a live deployed version of the application.

## How to run this application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev-start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
